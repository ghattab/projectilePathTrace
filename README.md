# projectilePathTrace
Linear regression and LSTM implementation to trace trajectory of a projectile.

# Dependencies
Python 3 - pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, keras 

# Run
`python3 train.py`

# Results
To plot data and results, uncomment some of the code in train.py meant for plotting.
predict path for projectile shot at an angle of 45 degrees and velocity of 10m/s
Results are saved in `result_lin_reg.csv`, `result_lin_reg_log.csv`, `result_lstm.csv`. 

Further insights are discussed in Report.pdf
